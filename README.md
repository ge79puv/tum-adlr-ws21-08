This repository is about Motion Planning: Unsupervised Path Regression, which is one of the projects in course ADLR of TUM. The authors are Yunfeng Kang and Yixin Mai with the help of our tutor Johannes.

In the project we combine the optimization-based algorithm [chompy](https://github.com/scleronomic/chompy.git) and neural network to obtain a short and collision-free path through unsupervised path regression. We compare different path representations, world representations and also their combinations to improve the result. The motion planning problem is extended from a sphere robot in single 2D world to a more complex static arm robot in multiple worlds.
